# EES-Code
To achieve my Industrial Cadets Gold award, I completed EES (Engineering in Education Scheme). As part of this, my team designed and created the ‘Pollution Solution’ HAT. 
I learnt how to use KiCad and used this to design the PCB that became the base of the HAT as well as getting heavily involved in the coding and debugging process.
